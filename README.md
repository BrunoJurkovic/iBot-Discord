# Welcome to iBot!

Welcome to iBot, this open source project is a bot for the chat platform Discord. It runs on the library discord.py, and it is on the latest rewrite branch!


# Features

iBot currently stores data in local files, but soon we plan on adding a database option. 
These are all the planned and current features:

 - Kick
 - Ban
 - Mute
 - Give & Revoke permission from users
 - Ping
 - Clear Chat
 - Database
 - TempBan
 - User Rewards
 - More

## Setup Guide

The setup for iBot is meant to be as simple as we can make it. It requires very little editing of the code, with only a few values to change!

> Note: All the mentions of a database are still at the planned stage, in other words not implemented, so this bot doesn't have any of the database features yet,

 1. Clone the iBot repository (**Master Branch!**)

> `git clone https://github.com/BrunoJurkovic/iBot-Discord.git --branch master`

2.  Install the project dependencies trough terminal or cmd. Make sure you have python installed on your host machine.

> `$pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Create a file named token, and put your discord secret token in there. 

4. (UNFINISHED): Make sure to change the database options in the config.

5. Run the bot by opening terminal or cmd and running:

> `$py main.py`
